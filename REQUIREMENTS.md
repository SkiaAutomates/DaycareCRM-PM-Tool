# Meaningful Beginnings CRM – Business Requirements

## 1. Child Age & Classroom Transitions
- **Date of Birth** is essential to calculate current age.
- Knowing the child's DOB and age determines when they are due for a **transition to the next classroom**.
- A **notification** should appear on the "Notifications" tab **1 month before** their transition date.

## 2. Scheduling & Availability Forecasting
- **FT (Full Time)**: Monday to Friday.
- **PT (Part Time)**: 2 or 3 days per week, varies based on family selection.
- The schedule data enables **forecasting** how many children are in each classroom on a specific date.
- This forecast should display on the **Availability** tab.

## 3. Weekly Attendance Schedule Display
- Child names on the Weekly Attendance Schedule should show **first name only** (no last name — it takes too much space).

## 4. Projects Tab Overhaul
- **Remove the option to add new names** when creating a project.
- Only allow selecting **existing data from the CRM** (existing parents/children).
- Add the following **new project types**:
  - **Onboarding Families** – counted on Reports tab, Onboarding/Offboarding table.
  - **Offboarding Families** – counted on Reports tab, Onboarding/Offboarding table.
  - **Waitlisted** – options:
    - Select an existing **parent name**.
    - Enter a **Desired Start Date**.
    - Select schedule type: **FT**, **PT**, **ELFA FT**, or **ELFA PT**.
    - If **PT** or **ELFA PT**, add option to choose which days of the week (Monday–Friday) they'd like to attend.
    - A **notification** should automatically appear **1 month before** the desired start date.
